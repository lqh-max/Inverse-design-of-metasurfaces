# Inverse-design-of-metasurfaces
This repository hosts a demonstration of a deep learning approach for the inverse design of metasurfaces, which consists of thousands of unit cells.
We wish we can design the targeted unit cell for given reflection phases within 1 second. x1000 faster than conventional methods.

The following papers have been published in relation to this repository:
1. [Inverse Design of Reflective Metasurface Antennas Using Deep Learning from Small-Scale Statistically Random Pico-Cells](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mop.34068)
2. [Energy Efficient Design of Low-Profile Wideband Microstrip Patch Antennas Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10276793)

We have design a GUI video that demonstrates the **Fast Design of Multi-Beam Metasurface Antennas**. You can watch it [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DbHDerEY6/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0).
Additionally, we have another video that demonstrates the **Inverse Design of Unit Cells**. You can watch it [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bx4y1D7LF/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=07c2e4f919ec533eb2ddf652d4ab4c9b).

The architecture of the network is shown in the figure below.

**More environment configurations and related code execution methods will be continuously updated within a week.**
